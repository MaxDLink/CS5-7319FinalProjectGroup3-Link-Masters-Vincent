### Selected Architecture: 

EventBus - one constant connection 


Event bus has lower latency which means a better user experience. Features are easier to add because the event bus structure decouples the features. Scalability is easier with event bus 


### Unselected Architecture: 

RESTFUL API - small procedure calls using api gateway. Clunkier than EventBus

RESTFUL architecture has low latency and it is difficult to maintain real time features
